##ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Paul here.

I'm an aspiring Developer and having just completed a software development course with Northcoders, I'm looking to land my first job as a software developer.
I am familiar with Javascript, Python and have designed projects front and back end projects using react, flask and both relational and non-relational databases.

```js
export function aspiringDeveloper()  { 
  Location: North-West England; 
  height: 187cm; 
  type: male; 
  currentlyWorkingOn: Stack-Dew-Valley Project.ðŸ”­ ;
  techStack: ['JavaScript', 'Python', 'CSS', 'HTML', 'SQL'];
  Tools: ['React', 'VUE', 'Jinja', 'Flask'];
  ðŸ˜„Pronouns: He/him;
  ðŸ“«How to reach me: 'testmango1965@yahoo.com;
  âš¡Fun fact1: 'Previously working in Mechanical / Electrical Engineering and I.T support gives me a unique take on problem solving'
  âš¡Fun fact1: I'm conversely a bit of a night owl, but also an early bird. ðŸ¤·
  currentlyLearning: [TypeScript, Phaser]
}

Currently I'm completing a final project from my time at Northcoders, called StackDew Valley.
